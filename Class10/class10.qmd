## 1. The PDB database 

The main repositiory of biomoelcular structure data is called the PDB found at: http://www.rcsb.org

Let's see what this database contains. I went to PDB > Analyze > PDB Statistics > By exp method and molecular type. 

```{r}
pdbstats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
x <- pdbstats$X.ray
sum(as.numeric(sub(",","", x)))
```

The comma in these numbers is causing them to be read as character rather than numeric. 
I can fix this by replacing "," fornothing "" with the `sub()` function: 

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbstats <- read_csv("Data Export Summary.csv")
pdbstats
```

I want to clean the column names so they are all lower case and don't have spaces in them 

```{r}
colnames(pdbstats)
```

```{r}
library(janitor)

df <- clean_names(pdbstats)
df
```

Total number of x-ray: 
```{r}
sum(df$x_ray)
```

Total number of structures: 
```{r}
sum(df$total)
```
Percent of x-ray structures: 

```{r}
((sum(df$x_ray))/(sum(df$total)))*100
```

Percent of EM structures: 

```{r}
((sum(df$em))/(sum(df$total)))*100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
(sum(df[1:3, "total"]))/(sum(df$total))*100
```

## 2. Using Mol* 

The main Mol* homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/ We can input our own PDB files or just give it a PDB database accession cod (4 letter PDB code).

## 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb)) 
```

> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 
MK1  

> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 
2 chians A and B 

Looking at the `pdb` object in more detail 

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

Let's try a new function not yet in the bio3d package. It requires the **r3dmol** package that we need to install with `install.packages("r3dmol")`

```{r}
source("https://tinyurl.com/viewpdb")
#view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "pink")
```

## 4. Prediciting functional dynamics 

We can use the `nma()` function in bio3d to predict the large-scale functional motions of biomolecules. 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

Write out a trajectory of the predicted molecular motion:
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
