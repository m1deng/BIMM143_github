# Can you improve this analysis code?

## Explanation for this function: 
This function that I created take the input string, which is the protein code, and it reads the PDB file of the input string. Then, we use the trim.pdb function to create a smaller PDB object. After that, it will take the output of s.chainA and accessing the atom column and b element. Finally, the function creates a plot of the output from s.b and label x as Bfactor and y as residue. 

```{r}
library(bio3d) 

analysis_fun <- function(string){
  s.name <- read.pdb(string)
  s.chainA <- trim.pdb(s.name, chain="A", elety="CA")
  s.b <- s.chainA$atom$b
  plotb3(s.b, sse=s.chainA, typ="l", ylab="Bfactor")
  
}

analysis_fun("4AKE")
analysis_fun("1AKE")
analysis_fun("1E4Y")
```
